2. REQUIREMENTS

* Installation of Packer (tested with version 1.6.4 from the Packer website).
The Ubuntu 20.04-provided version is *out of date*! Use the version from th
website instead, e.g. copy "packer" to /usr/local/bin.

* Important note about VirtualBox:
The Ubuntu-provided VirtualBox 6.1.10 had some issues with virtual serial ports!
Tested with version 6.1.14 from the Oracle website. However, this version has an
issue with EFI boot of FreeBSD and Ubuntu 12.10 beta! Bugs reported:
